                Yeast Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's
                the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.

            <li>
                Sugar To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm
                water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast
                something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll
                know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on
                top.

                Bread Flour Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit
                creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because
                it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten.
                Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.

                Olive Oil Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to
                pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it
                creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier
                prevents sogginess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor,
                strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows
                down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
